## Introduce

_Hi, I'm Rick Sanchez, I am an hacker/coder, I have start at 9 years on MS-DOS with QB45 (and a little of C and ASM x86)..._

_I explain all, just read that._

_It's an exemple of cryptomining terminal program ,with an arguments parsing for more... (I want just made easy exemples and share that)_

_You know I want share the best of python scripts, other software... It's my wish and my heart need coding sessions to be repair..._

_Coding sessions is my help for my broken heart(...love existance is like extraterrestrial-life research...) and that help with the solitude._

_And you know I have start the coffee and the programming practice at 9 years old... so now I love code, it's not painfull for me because is so good, with this skill I can contruct a lot of things and I can work with my A.D.H.D. now, I have an good level but I learn in continue and for me study's don't stop after school, today that continue from long years... coding skills is a superpower...-

_And the terminal is my world, programming inside, so a lot of terminal tools and configs I produce because I use vim in my world..._
